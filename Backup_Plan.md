If the PyPDFSplit application is not work or is not available, it is possible to split PDF files such as report cards using Adobe Acrobat.

## Setup
You will need the following
* Adobe Acrobat (installed on most ASH computers)
* Report Card file produced by Grade level (e.g. 2020 S1 G2.pdf) on your computer

## Procedure
This process will allow you to use the top-level bookmarks in each PDF to split the report into individual reports
